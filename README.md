## About This Project
A beginner's attempt at a file manager simulation using Python basics:

- Lists for data storage
- Loops for continuous operation
- Conditionals for decision-making
- Try-Except for error handling
- User input management

---

## Why I Built This
- Wanted to create a practical app without tutorials, focusing on data management.
- Practiced list operations, conditional logic, and basic error handling.
- Aimed to simulate file storage, deletion, and recovery—still learning advanced features.

---

## How to Run
1. Save as `file_manager_app.py`.
2. Run with `python file_manager_app.py` in your terminal.

---

## Features
|Feature|What It Does|
|-------|------------|
|Open App|Displays stored data if any|
|Enter Data|Adds user input to storage|
|Delete Data|Removes data with recycle bin option and clear all|
|Recycle Bin|Shows deleted data, allows restore (all or specific)|
|Exit|Closes the app|

## What can program do:
1. Open App
2. Enter Data
3. Delete Data
4. Recycle Bin
5. Exit

## Sample Flow
- Choose 2 → Enter "Note1" → "Note1 is added successfully..."
- Choose 3 → Enter "Note1" → "Note1 got deleted..." → "yes" → Stored in recycle
- Choose 4 → Choose 2 → Enter "Note1" → "Note1 has been restored..."
- Choose 5 → "Thank You for using our app..."

## Development Notes
- Self learning from youtube
- Uses basic Python (lists, loops, conditionals, try-except).
- This is raw—reflects my current skill level (beginner)

---

## NOTE
- README crafted with AI chatbot assistance.
- Kept raw to document my learning journey; plan to refine later.

---

## Fun Fact
- Took me one hour to write and half an hour fix errors
